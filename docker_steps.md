## Steps to run:

### Install docker in your system
refer to the following link: (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine)

### Login to docker from terminal

```linux
$ docker login
```
### Pull and run the image from the remote repository
 ```linux
 $ docker run -p 4000:90 likarajo/clock:1.0
```
> The user needs to goto internet browser, type **localhost:4000** as the url in the address bar, and press enter.
The user can then view the clock in the web browser.

> No matter where docker run executes, it pulls your image, along with all the dependencies, and runs the program code. 
It all travels together in a neat little package, and you donâ€™t need to install anything on the host machine for Docker to run it.
